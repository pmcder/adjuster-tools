### About

These are the adjuster tools that are on my personal website.
I have had good feedback from other claims adjusters that the pro rata tool is very useful
and easier to use than a spreadsheet.
I have a pending feature request from an adjuster to add an option negotiate by percent of initial offer rather than by dollar amount.
